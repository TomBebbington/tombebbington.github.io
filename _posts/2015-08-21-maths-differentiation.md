Differentiation is the process of finding the gradient / rate of change at a certain point in a graph.

## Representing it

The differentiated form of a function is represented as either \`f'(x)\` or \`dy/dx\`.

## Calculating it

### For simple equations
When \`f(x) = ax^n\`, \`f'(x) = nax^(n-1)\`.

###
+ When \`f(x) = sin(x)\`, \`f'(x) = cos(x)\`
+ When \`f(x) = cos(x)\`, \`f'(x) = -sin(x)\`
+ When \`f(x) = tan(x)\`, \`f'(x) = sec^2(x)\`
+ When \`f(x) = cot(x)\`, \`f'(x) = -csc^2(x)\`
+ When \`f(x) = sec(x)\`, \`f'(x) = sec(x) * tan(x)\`
+ When \`f(x) = csc(x)\`, \`f'(x) = -csc(x) * cot(x)\`
+ When \`f(x) = csc(x)\`, \`f'(x) = -csc(x) * cot(x)\`
