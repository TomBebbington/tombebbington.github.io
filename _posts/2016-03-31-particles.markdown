Atoms, as you should know from GCSE, consist of:

+ A positively-charged **nucleus**, containing **protons** and **neutrons**.
+ Negatively-charged **electron shells** surrounding the nucleus at different levels, that contain **electrons**.

# Constituents

| Constituent | Location | Weight / kg | Relative charge (in terms of \`-e\`) |Charge (C)|
|:------------|:---------|:------------|:-------------------------------------|:---------|
| Proton      | Nucleus | \`1.67 \times 10^-27 kg\` |  1  | \`+1.60 \times 10^-19\`
| Neutron     | Nucleus | \`1.67 \times 10^-27 kg\` |  0  | \`+0\`
| Electron    | Electron shells | \`9.11 \times 10^-31 kg\` |  -1  | \`-1.60 \times 10^-19 C\`

# Isotopes
**Isotopes** are atoms with the same number of protons but differing number of neutrons, therefore of the same element. The notation used consists of:

+ The number of nucleons \`A\` is written in superscript.
+ The symbol of the element \`X\` is written to the right.
+ The number of protons \`Z\` is written in subscript.

# Specific charge

**Specific charge** is the charge per unit of mass, and is calculated with:

\`C (Ckg^-1) = \frac{Q (C)}{m (kg)}\`
