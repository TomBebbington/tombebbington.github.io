# Legal and ethical issues

## Legal issues

**Legal issues** are those that are forbidden by laws. Examples:

+ Infringing copyright by downloading a music video without payment.

## Ethical issues

**Ethical issues** determine people's moral principles. Examples:

+ Downloading Youtube videos as MP3s.
+ Installing illegal copies of software.
+ Straming movies / tv without paying a subscription.

# Use and misuse of personal data

**Personal data** is anything unique to you, such as your name, address, debit card details etc. There are an awful lot of organisations that collect and hoard people's personal data. (*gotta collect em' all!*). This data can include:

+ Income and debts
+ Relationship status
+ Health
+ Employment status
+ Religious views
+ Political views

This is an issue because:
+ Our **Personal Privacy** is infringed as we never give explicit consent for a lot of forms.
+ **Data Security** - how much of the data we use can be guranteed to be secure?
+ **Misuse of Data** - this is the use of data collected for one thing for something else.
+ **Surveillance by government** - this is the government's monitoring of phone calls, messages, data etc. in order to be able to monitor people.
+ **Online profile** - you have to be careful about your privacy settings as your posts on social networks aren't deleted with time.
+ Profiling - lots of organisations use their accumulated data to build profiles about people based on their history.
