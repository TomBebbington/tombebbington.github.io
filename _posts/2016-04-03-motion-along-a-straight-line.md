**Displacement** ($s$) is the distance between some object and its starting point, that has both distance and direction, and is usually measured in $ m $.

**Speed** ($v$) is the change of distance per unit of time (usually seconds), and is usually measured in $ ms^-1 $.

**Velocity** ($v$) is the change of displacement per unit of time, and is usually measured in $ ms^-1 $.
