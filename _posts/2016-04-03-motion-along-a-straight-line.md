title: Motion along a straight line
---

**Displacement** ($s$) is the distance between some object and its starting point, that has both distance and direction, and is usually measured in $ m $.

**Speed** ($v$) is the change of distance per unit of time (usually seconds), and is usually measured in $ ms^-1 $.

**Velocity** ($v$) is the change of displacement per unit of time, and is usually measured in $ ms^-1 $.

# Motion along a straight line:

When an object is moving in a straight line (usually straight down), several equations can be applied to it depending on what is constant throughout the movement: the acceleration or the velocity.

## Uniform velocity

$$ v = \frac{\delta s}{\delta t} $$

$$ a = \frac{\delta v}{\delta t} $$

## Uniform acceleration

Note that the value of acceleration for gravity is $g$.

$$ v = u + at $$

$$ s = \frac{u + v}{2} \times t $$

$$ s = ut + \frac{at^2}{2} $$

$$ v^2 = u^2 + 2as $$

# Terminal speed
**Terminal speed** is the speed at which both the forward force of an object and its backwards force are equal.
