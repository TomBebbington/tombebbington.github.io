A **relational database** is a database using tables of related data that is only stored once. Instead of repeating data, numerical links are made between them so the data isn't repeated.

An **entity** is an individual thing about which data is stored.

An **attribute** is a piece of information about an entity stored as a field in a relational database. There are several kinds of attribute:

+ A **primary key** is a kind of attribute that uniquely identifies each individual record.
+ A **composite primary key** is a combination of attributes that uniquely identify each record.
+ A **foreign key** is a primary key from another table.

**Reference integrity** is how if a primary key appears in one table it must appear in another.

A normalised database will either have a one-to-one, or a one-to-many relationship.
