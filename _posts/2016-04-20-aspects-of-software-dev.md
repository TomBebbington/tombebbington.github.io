summary: "Apart from the coding itself, there are a lot of steps that go into going from a problem to a computational solution."
---
# Analysis

Before a solution can be created for a problem, what the system will need must be established and a data model should be created.

# Design

Before writing a solution, the heirarchy and structure of the code needed to implement it should be designed.

# Implementation

Models and algorithms must be implemented as data structures and algorithms so that computers understand them. 

# Testing

The implementation must be checked for consistency.
# Evaluation
