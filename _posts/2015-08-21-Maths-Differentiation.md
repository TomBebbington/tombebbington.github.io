_Differentiation_ is the process of finding the gradient / rate of change at a certain point in a graph.

## Representing it

The differentiated form of a function is represented as either \`f'(x)\`, \`(Δy)/(Δx)\` or \`dy/dx\`.

## Calculating it

### For simple equations
When \`f(x) = ax^n\`, \`f'(x) = nax^(n-1)\`.

### For trigonometric functions
+ \`sin'(x) = cos(x)\`
+ \`cos'(x) = -sin(x)\`
+ \`tan'(x) = sec^2(x)\`
+ \`cot'(x) = -csc^2(x)\`
+ \`sec'(x) = sec(x) * tan(x)\`
+ \`csc'(x) = -csc(x) * cot(x)\`
+ \`arcsin'(x) = 1/sqrt(1-x^2)\`
+ \`arccos'(x) = -1/sqrt(1-x^2)\`
+ \`arctan'(x) = 1/(x^2 + 1)\`
