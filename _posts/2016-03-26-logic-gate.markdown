The following logic gates are available for computer circuits:

# The NOT gate
The **NOT gate** inverts the signal passed through it.

# The AND gate
The **AND gate**, which takes two signals and yields a 1 only if both signals are 1.

# The XOR gate
The **XOR gate**, which takes two signals and yields a 1 if one signal is 1.

# The NAND gate
The **NAND gate**, which takes two signals and yields a 1 if both signals aren't 1.

# The NOR gate
The **NOR gate**, which takes two signals and yields a 1 if none of the signals are 1.
