# The strong nuclear force
The **strong nuclear force** is the force that holds stable isotope's nuclei together, and it balances with the electrostatic force of repulsion between the nucleus' protons.

## Effect

+ Its effect is the same regardless what kind of particle it is between.
+ Its range is below \`3-4 fm\`, and is similar to the diameter of a small nucleus.
+ It attracts between the distances \`0.5 fm\` and \`3.4 fm\`.
+ Below `0.5 fm` it is repulsive.

# Radiactive decay

The following types of radiation can be released by radioactive isotopes:

+ **Alpha radiation** (\`\alpha\`) consists of helium nuclei, which have a relative mass of 4 and a charge of 2.
+ **Beta radiation** (\`\beta\`) consists of fast-moving electrons, and have a relative mass of 0 and a charge of -1.
+ **Gamma radiation** (\`\gamma\`) is a kind of electromagnetic radiation that is emitted by unstable nuclei with excess energy, after an alpha or beta emission.
