# CPU Components

## Units

+ The **Arithmetic Logic Unit** (ALU) handles mathematical and logical operations such as additions, subtractions and comparisions.
+ The **Control Unit** (CU) uses electrical signals to ensure instructions are executed in sequential order.

## Registers

**Registers** are small areas to store and sort data on the CPU no matter the architecture.

## Other components

+ The **Program Counter** (PC) counts which instructions have been executed and which is next - this information is passed to the **Control Unit**.
+ The **Cache** is a bit of reallly fast memory, that instructions and data are loaded into from RAM before being ran on the CPU. This a form of volatile memory.
+ The **Bus** is a pathway between CPU components. Data and control signals travel through the bus inside th CPU to the different components.
