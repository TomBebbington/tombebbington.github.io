**Quadratic equations** are a special kind of equation that come in two forms:

$$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$

$$ (x - \alpha)(x - \beta) = 0 $$

# Difference from linear equations
As you may know already, an equation's roots are the x-coordinates where the curve of the equation touches the x-axis ($y = 0$). **Linear equations** make straight lines so they only have a single root, whereas quadratic equations can have two roots and form a curve, therefore they are not linear.

# Solving
To find the value of x, we use the **quadratic formula**:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
