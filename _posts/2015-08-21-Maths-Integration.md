Integration is the process of finding the equation of a graph from the equation of its gradient. It is the exact inverse of differentiation.

## Representing it

The integrated form of a function is represented as \`\int f(x)\`, or \`f(x)\` when \`f'(x)\` is given.

## Calculating it

### For simple equations
When \`f'(x) = ax^n\`, \`f(x) = (ax^(n+1))/(n+1) + C\`.
\'C\' represents the integration constant, which is an unknown number you must calculate using the values you are given.

### For trigonometric functions
+ \'\int cos(x) = sin(x)\'
+ \`sin'(x) = cos(x)\`
+ \`cos'(x) = -sin(x)\`
+ \`tan'(x) = sec^2(x)\`
+ \`cot'(x) = -csc^2(x)\`
+ \`sec'(x) = sec(x) * tan(x)\`
+ \`csc'(x) = -csc(x) * cot(x)\`
+ \`arcsin'(x) = 1/sqrt(1-x^2)\`
+ \`arccos'(x) = -1/sqrt(1-x^2)\`
+ \`arctan'(x) = 1/(x^2 + 1)\`
