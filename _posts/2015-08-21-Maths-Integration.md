Integration is the process of finding the equation of a graph from the equation of its gradient. It is the exact inverse of differentiation.

## Representing it

The integrated form of a function is represented as \`\int f(x)\`, or \`f(x)\` when \`f'(x)\` is given.

## Calculating it

### For simple equations
When \`f'(x) = ax^n\`, \`f(x) = (ax^(n+1))/(n+1) + C\`.
\'C\' represents the integration constant, which is an unknown number you must calculate using the values you are given.

### For trigonometric functions
+ \`\int cos(x) = sin(x)\`
+ \`\int -sin(x) = cos(x)\`
+ \`\int sec^2(x) = tan(x)\`
+ \`\int -csc^2(x) = cot(x)\`
+ \`\int sec(x) * tan(x) = sec(x)\`
+ \`\int -csc(x) * cot(x) = csc(x)\`
+ \`\int 1/sqrt(1-x^2) = arcsin(x)\`
+ \`\int -1/sqrt(1-x^2) = arccos(x)\`
+ \`\int 1/(x^2 + 1) = arctan(x)\`
