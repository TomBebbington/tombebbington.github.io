Boolean algebra is a way of expressing operations on `true` / `false` numbers with a mathematical syntax. The following are the laws of Boolean algebra:

Boolean algebra is simplified to simplify the underlying circuit, thus reducing how many components the circuit requires. This causes the ciruit to be:

+ Cheaper
+ More efficient
+ With less gates: more reliable.

# Operations

## NOT

$$ \overline{A} $$

| A | NOT A |
|---|--------------|
| 0 | 1            |
| 1 | 0            |

## OR

$$ A + B $$

| A | B | A OR B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |
| 1 | 1 | 1     |

## NOR

$$ \overline{A + B} $$

| A | B | A OR B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 1     |
| 0 | 1 | 0     |
| 1 | 0 | 0     |
| 1 | 1 | 0     |

## AND

$$ A . B $$

| A | B | A AND B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 0     |
| 1 | 0 | 0     |
| 1 | 1 | 1     |

## NAND

$$ \overline{A . B} $$

| A | B | A NAND B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 1     |
| 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |
| 1 | 1 | 0     |


## XOR

$$ A \xor B $$

| A | B | A XOR B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |
| 1 | 1 | 0     |


# Laws

## The Identity law

These are self-explanatory key laws.

$$ A + 0 = A $$
$$ A + A = A $$
$$ A + \overline{A} = 1 $$
$$ A \cdot 0 = 0 $$
$$ A \cdot 1 = 1 $$
$$ A \cdot A = A $$
$$ A \cdot \overline{A} = 0 $$

## The Null Law

$$ A + 1 = 1 $$

## The Commutative law

This states that in an **AND** or **OR** operation, the operands can be swapped without affecting the result of the operation.

$$ A + B = B + A $$

## The Associative law

This states that the order you group operands in for **OR** and **AND** operations doesn't matter, so long as the original order is preserved:

$$ (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) $$

## The Distributive law

This states that in an **AND** operation, if one of the operands is an **OR** operation, it can be expanded by **OR**ing the results of **AND**ng the value outside the brackets and the ones inside:

$$ A \cdot (B + C) = A \cdot B + A \cdot C $$

## The Identity law

This states that **OR** or **AND** operations on the same number yield that number.

$$ A + A = A $$
$$ A \cdot A = A $$

## The Negation law

This states that double negatives cancel out:

$$ \overline{\overline{A}} = A $$

## The Redundancy law

This states that in an **OR** operation, the second value is redundant if it is **OR**ed into the first value:

$$ A + A \cdot B = A $$
$$ A \cdot (A + B) = A $$

## De Morgan's laws

These state that in **AND** / **OR** expressions that are all negative, you can 'break the bar' by splitting it and changing the operation to **OR** / **AND**:

$$\overline{A \cdot B} = \overline{A} + \overline{B}$$
$$\overline{A + B} = \overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}$$
