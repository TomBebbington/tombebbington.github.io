summary: How particles interactions are exchanged.
---

# Exchange particles
Every single force must be exchanged by particles called **exchange particles**.
**Virtual photons** ($\lambda$) are an example of these as they exchange the electromagnetic force, but cannot be detected directly.

# Weak interaction
The **weak nuclear force** is responsible for:

+ Changing a proton to a neutron in $\beta^+$ decay
+ Changing a neutron to a proton in $\beta^-$ decay.
It does not affect stable nuclei, and its exchange particle is the $W^+$ and the $W^-$.
