# Vectors

**Vectors** have both magnitude and direction, as opposed to **scalars**, which only have magnitude.

## Resolving components

You can find the **horizontal component** / **x** of a vector when you have its magnitude $d$ and direction $\theta$ using trigonometry:

$$ x = d \times \cos(\theta) $$

You can find the **vertical component** / **y** of a vector when you have its magnitude $d$ and direction $\theta$ by the same method:

$$ y = d \times \sin(\theta) $$

## Addition

### With a calculator
When adding two perpendicual forces vectors, use the following basic geometric equations:
### Magnitude
$$ F = \sqrt{F_{1}^2 + F_{2}^2}
### Direction
$$ \theta = \atan(\frac{F_2}{F_1}) $$
