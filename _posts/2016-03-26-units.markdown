# Bits and bytes
A **bit** is a single true/false value and is the smallest value computers can manipulate.

A **byte** is 8 bits, and every size stored on a computer is in bytes.

A **word** is the word-length of the processor, usually 32 bits or 64 bits.

# Units
Bytes can be given in two different kinds of units:

+ Decimal prefixes
+ Binary prefixes

## Decimal prefixes
The decimal prefixes are in powers of ten, with the usual scientific units:

* A kilobyte (k) is \`10^3\` bytes.
* A megabyte (M) is \`10^6\` bytes.
* A gigabyte (G) is \`10^9\` bytes.
* A terabyte (T) is \`10^12\` bytes.

## Binary prefixes
The binary prefixes are in powers of two, and are preferred in programming due to them being faster to work with.

* A kibibyte (Ki) is \`2^10\` bytes.
* A mebibyte (Mi) is \`2^20\` bytes.
* A gibibyte (Gi) is \`2^30\` bytes.
* A tebibyte (Ti) is \`2^40\` bytes.
