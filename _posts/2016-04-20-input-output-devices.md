# Barcode reader

**Barcode readers** emit lasers that reflect off the barcode. The white parts of the barcode will have higher light intensity than the black parts, so this can be used with a sensor to read each bit of a barcode.

# Digital camera

1. The computer sends data to the printer about the document it's printing.
2. An electronic circuit handles figuring out how this document should be drawn.
3. A laser beam scans back and forth inside the printer, building up a pattern with static electricity.
4. The positively charged toner (powdered ink) is attracted on the page by the static electricity.
5. A fuser unit (two heat rollers) bonds the toner to the paper.
6. The paper is rolled out.
