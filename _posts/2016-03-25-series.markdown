Summation of series can often be calculated by substituting in the following formulas:
\`sum_{r=1}^{n} 1 = n\`

\`sum_{r=1}^{n} r = \frac{1}{2}n(n + 1)\`

\`sum_{r=1}^{n} r^2 = \frac{1}{6}n(n + 1)(2n + 1)\`

\`sum_{r=1}^{n} r^3 = \frac{1}{4}n^2(n + 1)^2\`

You can then use these equations to break down bits of a summation overr a series until it simplifies into something solvable.
