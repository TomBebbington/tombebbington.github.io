title: Moments

A **moment** is a force applied about a distance. The moment $m$ of a force $F$ about a point with a perpendicular distance of $d$ can be resolved by the equation:

$$m = F \times d$$

# The principle of moments
This is a fundamental law of physics that states that the sum of the moments going clockwise must equal the sum of the moments going anticlockwise. This can be represented by the equation:

$$
m_1 = m_2
F_1 \times c_1 = F_2 \times c_2 
$$

# Centre of mass
The **centre of mass** of an object is the point at which one of the forces has no turning effect. This can be calculated:

+ Mathematically if you know the object is **uniform** and you know its dimensions.
+ Scientifically by doing the plum line experiment with the object.
