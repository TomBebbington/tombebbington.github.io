# Antiparticles
For every single kind of subatomic particle, there is an **antiparticle** with the following properties:

+ Equal rest mass.
+ Opposite charge.
+ Annihilates it and the particle when they meet, and convert their masses into photons.

## Fundamental antiparticles
+ **Positrons** (\(_{-1}^0\beta\)) are the antiparticle to **electrons**, as they have opposite charge (\`-e\`) and equal rest mass.
+ **Antiprotons** (\(\overline{p}\)) are the antiparticle to **protons**, as they have opposite charge (\`-e\` but equal rest mass.
+ **Antineutrons** (\(\overline{n}\)) are the antiparticle to **neutrons**, as they have opposite charge (still \`0\`) but equal rest mass.
+ **Antineutrinos** (\(\overline{v}\)) are the antiparticle to **neutrinos**, as they have opposite charge (still \`0\`) but equal rest mass.

# Photons
Electromagnetic waves are emitted in packets that leave the source in various different directions; these packets are known as **photons**. Their energy can be calculated by:

\(E_p = hf = \frac{hc}{f}\)

## The phlanck constant
\(h = 6.63 \times 10^-34 Js\)
